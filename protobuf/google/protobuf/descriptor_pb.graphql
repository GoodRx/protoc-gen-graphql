  A Location identifies a piece of source code in a .proto file which

  tools.

  For example, say we have a file like:
    message Foo {
      optional string foo = 1;
    }
  Let's look at just the field definition:
    optional string foo = 1;
    ^       ^^     ^^  ^  ^^^
    a       bc     de  f  ghi
  We have the following locations:
    span   path               represents
    [a,i)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0 ]     The whole field definition.
    [a,b)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 4 ]  The label (optional).

    [g,h)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 3 ]  The number (1).

  Notes:
  - A location may refer to a repeated field itself (i.e. not to any
    particular index within it).  This is used whenever a set of elements are
    logically enclosed in a single code segment.  For example, an entire
    extend block (possibly containing multiple extension definitions) will
    have an outer location whose path refers to the "extensions" repeated
    field without an index.
  - Multiple locations may have the same path.  This happens when a single
    logical declaration is spread out across multiple places.  The most
    obvious example is the "extend" block again -- there may be multiple
    extend blocks in the same scope, each of which will have the same path.
  - A location's span is not always a subset of its parent's span.  For
    example, the "extendee" of an extension declaration appears at the
    beginning of the "extend" block and is shared by all extensions within
    the block.
  - Just because a location's span is a subset of some other location's span
    does not mean that it is a descendent.  For example, a "group" defines
    both a type and a field in a single declaration.  Thus, the locations
    corresponding to the type and field and their components will overlap.
  - Code which tries to interpret locations should probably be designed to
    ignore those that it doesn't understand, as more types of locations could
    be recorded in the future.
